DIVINUM
Description
Divinum is an ambitious and innovative video game project that transcends traditional gaming boundaries. Rooted in the strategic prowess of games like chess and the immersive storytelling of Dungeons and Dragons, Divinum is designed to be a captivating and accessible 3D strategy game. Players will take command of two distinct factions, the Divinites and the Infernites, in epic battles set on customizable, buildable terrain. Our project's core vision revolves around the fusing of strategy and adventure with immersive 3D terrain that can be transformed with creativity. This involves different game modes, storytelling, and more.
